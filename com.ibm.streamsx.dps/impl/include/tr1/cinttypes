/*
This workaround is done for a libmemcached compiler error on RHEL5 and CentOS5.
In these versions of Linux, if you have a gcc version below 4.2, then our dps library code 
will give an error during compilation. That error will look like this:

./libmemcached-1.0/memcached.h:46:27: error: tr1/cinttypes: No such file or directory 

This fix should take care of that error.
